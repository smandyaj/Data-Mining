function [trained_weights] = train_LR_Classifier(training_matrix,training_label,num_classes)

% This function trains a logistic regression classification model

% Input
%========
% training_matrix    -> The matrix of training data points (each row is a
%                       sample and each column is a feature)
% training_label     -> The class labels of the training points
% num_classes        -> The possible number of classes

% Output
%========
% trained_weights    -> The weights of the trained logistic regression
%                       classifier (cell array)
