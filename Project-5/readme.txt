CSE 572 : Data Mining Assignment-5/Mini-Project-3	
Group Members: Santosh Mandya Jayaram, Rahul Rao, Kaustav Basu

a. We assume Matlab latest version + statistical machine learning toolbox for matlab are installed on the machine, if not please install them.

Problem 1: Load/Copy the svm_p1.m script into the same directory as the dataset 'Multi Label Scene Data'.
		a. Change to the dataset directory from the matlab.
		b. use this command to run the file >> run svm_p1.m or click the run button on the menu.
		c. It will print out the result
			Accuracy of SVM using Polynomial kernel: 64.351341 
			Accuracy of SVM using Guassian kernel: 64.700478


Problem 2:Load/Copy the svm_p2.m,nn_p2.m,knn_p2.m,wrapper_p2.m script into the same directory as the dataset 'Handwritten Digits'.
		a. Change to the dataset directory from the matlab.
		b. use this command to run the file >> rwrapper_p2.m or click the run button on the menu.
		c. It will print out the result
			Accuracy of SVM : 94.740080 
			Accuracy of KNN : 95.232236 
			Accuracy of NN : 92.310058 
			Accuracy of Ensemble : 95.478314
