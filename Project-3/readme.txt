CSE 572 : Data Mining Assignment-3
Group Members: Santosh Mandya Jayaram, Rahul Rao

a. We assume Matlab latest version + statistical machine learning toolbox for matlab are installed on the machine if not please install them.
b. Please load/copy the required test data and train data to directory in your machine.
c. Load the scripts in your matlab workspace.
d. Open all the required .m files in the matlab.
e. Change the file path according to the problem - Problem 1 : Human Activity Recognition directory and Problem 2: VidTIMIT directory

Problem 1:
Change the "file path according to the problem - Problem 1 : Human Activity Recognition directory

1. knn_classifier_p1.m
		a. Change the "file_path" variable to appropriate directory that contains the training and testing data.
		b. use this command to run the file >> run knn_classifier_p1.m or click the run button on the menu.
		c. It will print out the result- Accuracy of KNN : 90.023753

2. svm_p1.m
		a. Change the "file_path" variable to appropriate directory that contains the training and testing data.
		b. use this command to run the file >> run svm_p1.m or click the run button on the menu.
		c. It will print out the result- Accuracy of SVM : 96.844248


Problem 2:
Change the file path according to the problem - Problem 2 : VidTIMIT directory

1. knn_classifier_p2.m
		a. Change the "file_path" variable to appropriate directory that contains the training and testing data.
		b. use this command to run the file >> run knn_classifier_p2.m or click the run button on the menu.
		c. It will print out the result- Accuracy of KNN : 98.600000

2. svm_p2.m
		a. Change the "file_path" variable to appropriate directory that contains the training and testing data.
		b. use this command to run the file >> svm_p2.m or click the run button on the menu.
		c. It will print out the result- Accuracy of SVM : 99.500000

3. FeedForwardNN.m
		a. Change the "file_path" variable to appropriate directory that contains the training and testing data.
		b. use this command to run the file >> run FeedForwardNN.m or click the run button on the menu.
		c. It will print out the result- Accuracy of ANN : 97.000000
